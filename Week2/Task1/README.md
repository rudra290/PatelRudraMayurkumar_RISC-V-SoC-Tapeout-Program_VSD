<summary><strong>1. Understanding System on a Chip (SoC)</strong></summary>

A **System on Chip (SoC)** is a single integrated circuit (IC) that combines multiple system components into one chip. It provides the computational power of a traditional computer or embedded system in a compact, power-efficient, and scalable form.

Unlike a **microprocessor** that only contains the CPU, or a **microcontroller (MCU)** that combines CPU with some fixed peripherals and memory, an SoC integrates:

-   **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** – General-purpose processing
-   **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** – Rendering and graphics acceleration
-   **NPU / AI Accelerator** – For machine learning and neural networks
-   **Memory blocks** – SRAM, DRAM controllers, ROM, Cache
-   **Communication interfaces** – USB, UART, I2C, SPI, PCIe, Ethernet
-   **Multimedia components** – Audio/Video codecs, ISP (Image Signal Processor)
-   **Security modules** – Cryptographic engines, secure boot
-   **Power management** – PMIC, DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling)

### Why SoC instead of MCU or Microprocessor?

-   **Integration**: More components in one chip = less PCB space
-   **Performance**: Faster communication due to proximity of components
-   **Flexibility**: Can work with multiple types of RAM/ROM and peripherals
-   **Power Efficiency**: Optimized for high performance per watt
-   **Cost**: Economical at scale, especially for mass-market products
