# Day 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis

The Reposetory is about day 1 of week 1 of RISCâ€‘V Reference SoC Tapeout Program.
In this day I learn about RTL design and synthesys.

## 1. Introduction to open-source simulator iverilog

In this lecture I learn about the verilog HDL and iverilog. Verilog is hardware discription language. which describe the behaviour of the hardwave. To language are currently exict 1. verilog. 2. VHDl. Verilog is based on C language, case sensitive language.
iverilog is the tool which helps to simulaten the verilog code. Here I learn about the RTL simulation.

The flow of the iverilog is as shown below.
