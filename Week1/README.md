## 📘 Overview  

This workshop is designed for **students, hobbyists, and engineers** who want to:  

- Learn **Verilog RTL design and simulation**  
- Use **Icarus Verilog + GTKWave** for simulation and waveform analysis  
- Perform **logic synthesis with Yosys** and the **Sky130 PDK**  
- Understand **testbenches, timing constraints, flip-flop coding styles, and optimization**  

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites  

- ✅ Basics of digital logic (gates, MUX, flip-flops)  
- ✅ Familiarity with Linux shell commands  
- ✅ A Linux environment (or WSL on Windows/macOS)  
- ✅ Installed tools: `git`, `iverilog`, `gtkwave`, `yosys`, text editor (e.g. Vim, VS Code)
