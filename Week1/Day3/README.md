## 1. Introduction to Optimizations  

Optimization in digital circuits refers to **improving area, delay, and power** without altering the functionality.  
This is done using:  

- **Boolean algebra simplification** (K-map, algebraic laws)  
- **Redundancy removal** (unnecessary gates or signals)  
- **Logic restructuring** (rearranging equations for better performance)  
- **Sequential restructuring** (moving or cloning registers for better timing balance)  

ðŸ”‘ **Goal:** Reduce silicon area, improve speed, and lower power consumption.

## 2. Combinational Logic Optimizations  

Techniques applied to purely **combinational circuits**:  

- **Boolean simplification**  
  Example:  
y = aÂ·b + aÂ·b' â†’ y = a
- **Common sub-expression elimination**  
If multiple expressions share the same logic, compute it once and reuse it.  
- **Constant propagation**  
Replace inputs with known constants at compile-time.  
y = a & 1 â†’ y = a
y = b | 0 â†’ y = b
- **Dead logic elimination**  
Gates that never affect the output are removed.

## 3. Sequential Logic Optimizations  

Sequential circuits introduce **flip-flops and state machines**. Optimizations include:  

### ðŸ”¹ State Minimization  
- Remove redundant states in an FSM.  
- Merge equivalent states that produce the same outputs and transitions.  

### ðŸ”¹ State Encoding Optimization  
- One-hot, Gray, or binary encoding chosen depending on **speed vs area trade-off**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Retiming  
- Move registers across combinational logic to **balance delays** and improve timing.  

### ðŸ”¹ Cloning  
- Duplicate a register close to multiple fan-out paths to **reduce load** and improve timing closure.

## 4. Sequential Optimizations for Unused Outputs  

When a registerâ€™s output is **never observed** (unused in final circuit), synthesis tools:  

- **Remove those flops** automatically.  
- Replace with constant values (0 or 1).  
- Reduce power and area by eliminating unnecessary storage elements.  

This process is called **register pruning**.
