## 1. GLS, Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch and Blocking/Non-blocking Statements

### üîç What is GLS?

**GLS** stands for **Gate-Level Simulation**.

It is a form of simulation that uses the **gate-level netlist** (typically post-synthesis or post-layout) instead of RTL.

### ‚úÖ Why GLS?

- To **verify** the design functionality after synthesis.
- To catch mismatches between **RTL simulation** and **synthesized netlist**.
- To ensure **timing correctness** (especially in post-layout GLS with SDF).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch

Common causes of mismatches between RTL and synthesized netlist simulations:

- **Missing sensitivity list** in combinational logic.
- **Incorrect use of blocking (`=`) vs non-blocking (`<=`)** assignments.
- **Unintended latch inference** or synthesis pruning.

---

### üîÅ Caveats with Blocking Statements

Improper use of **blocking assignments** can lead to **synth-sim mismatches**, especially in combinational blocks.

Use **non-blocking** (`<=`) for sequential logic and **blocking** (`=`) with care in combinational logic.

## 2. üß™ Labs on GLS and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch

### üí° How to get GLS?

Use **Yosys** to generate a netlist, and simulate it with the **same testbench** used for RTL.

#### üì¶ Yosys Tip:

To create a cleaner, more readable netlist, use the `-noattr` option:

```tcl
write_verilog -noattr synthesized_design.v
```
-- This removes all synthesis attributes like (* keep *), (* full_case *), etc.
-- Improves readability and downstream compatibility.
